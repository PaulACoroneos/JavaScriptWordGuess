## Description
This repository holds a hangman style word guess game implemented in HTML/CSS/JS. A word bank is pre-defined including a corresponding image. The word to guess is displayed to the user with each letter replaced with an underscore. The user then uses their keyboard to start getting letters. The game has protection to ensure the user uses a valid english character or that the letter hasn't already been guessed. As letters as guessed they are displayed to the user. If the letter is part of the word to guess it also replaces the underscores.

The game is over when either the user guessses all characters or the user runs out of guesses. Either way the word and corresponding image are displayed. The game also will keep track of wins and losses.
